abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling can be a highly sensitive method for detecting aquatic taxa; however, the cost-efficiency of this technique relative to traditional methods has not been rigorously assessed. We show how methods that account for imperfect and stochastic detection can be used to (i) determine the optimal allocation of survey effort with eDNA sampling for a fixed budget (i.e. identify the optimal combination of water samples vs. site visits), and (ii) assess the cost-efficiency of eDNA sampling relative to traditional survey techniques. We illustrate this approach by comparing eDNA sampling and bottle-trapping for an exotic newt species (Lissotriton v. vulgaris) recently detected in Melbourne, Australia. Bottle traps produced much lower detection rates than eDNA sampling, but the cost-efficiency of the two methods can be similar because bottle-trapping is cheaper per sample. The relative cost-efficiency of the two sampling methods was sensitive to the available survey budget, the costs of eDNA primer/probe development and sample processing and the number of positive quantitative PCR assays (qPCRs) used to designate a water sample as positive for newt DNA. Environmental DNA sampling was more cost-efficient than bottle-trapping for small to intermediate budgets when primer/probe development and sample processing costs were low, and 1/4 or 2/4 positive qPCRs were used to label a water sample as positive for newt eDNA. However, bottle traps were generally more cost-efficient than eDNA sampling when primer/probe development and sample processing costs were high, regardless of qPCR threshold or survey budget. Traditional sampling methods may achieve lower detection probabilities compared to eDNA sampling, but the totality of costs can make eDNA sampling less efficient than traditional techniques in some circumstances. Our approach provides a quantitative framework for determining how many water samples and site visits are required to maximize detection probabilities with eDNA sampling, and can calculate the cost-efficiency of any sampling method.},

abstract = {Recent advances in tracking technology are based on the use of miniature sensors for recording new aspects of individual migratory behaviour. In this study, we have used activity data loggers with barometric and temperature sensors to record the flight altitudes as well as ground elevations during stationary periods of migratory songbirds. We tracked one individual of red-backed shrike and one great reed warbler along their autumn migration from Europe to Africa. Both individuals performed their migration stepwise in travel segments and climbed most metres during the passage across the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert and least metres during the first flight segment in Europe. The great reed warbler reached its highest flight altitude of 3950 m a.s.l. during the travel segment from Europe to west Africa, while the red-backed shrike reached 3650 m a.s.l as maximum flight altitude during its travel segment from Sahel to southern Africa. Both individuals used both lowlands and highlands for resting periods along their migrations. Furthermore, temperature decreased with increasing altitude during migratory flights for both individuals, highlighting the potential to determine flight duration from temperature measurements. Finally, we discuss how barometric data could be used to investigate birds' responses to changes in air pressure as a cue for departures on migratory flights. This new technique, i.e. using a miniature data logger with barometric pressure sensor to estimate flight altitudes and ground elevations, will open up new avenues for research and importantly advance our understanding on how small birds behave during migratory flights.},

abstract = {Tracking return migrations in songbirds has been impossible until recently when miniaturization of light-level loggers enabled observation of the first complete round trip. Although geolocators are extensively used on animals at sea, little is known about how accurate geolocators are for tracking terrestrial or forest-dwelling migrants. To test the accuracy of geolocators for tracking migratory songbirds living in forested habitat, we calibrated geolocators to a source population located in central Europe and collected location estimates based on the source population calibration from stationary geolocators deployed over an 800km NE to SW gradient in Western Europe. Additionally, we fit non-migratory songbirds (European blackbirds, Turdus merula) with geolocators for 12months to compare known locations of individuals with locations estimated by geolocators. We found an average error ±95% CI of 201±43km in latitude for stationary geolocators in forest habitat. Longitude error was considerably lower (12±03km). The most accurate geolocator was on average 23km off target, the worst was on average 390km off. The winter latitude estimate error for geolocators deployed on sedentary birds was on average (±95% CI) 143±62km when geolocators were calibrated during the breeding season and 132±75km when they were calibrated during the winter. Longitude error for geolocators deployed on birds was on average (±95% CI) 50±34km. Although we found error most likely due to seasonal changes in habitat and behaviour, our results indicate that geolocators can be used to reliably track long-distance forest-dwelling migrants. We also found that the low degree of error for longitude estimates attained from geolocators makes this technology suitable for identifying relatively short-distance movements in longitude. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {This report reviews all the bird species that have been recorded in the middle Save River valley (between Massangena in the west and Covane in the east) in Mocambique, including the results of a recent survey made in November 1998. A total of 268 bird species has been recorded from the region, including 11 new species found in November 1998. Twenty-five species were recorded from the area by early expeditions (mainly in 1950, 1963 and 1965) that have not been found in recent times. Thirteen of these are waterbirds, suggesting that these early surveys were made during wetter periods than the subsequent efforts and/or that upstream water extraction has resulted in a reduction in waterbird diversity in recent times. Of the remaining 12 dryland species, nine may have been overlooked by recent surveys but three species (Ostrich Struthio camelus, Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus and Crested Guineafowl Guttera pucherani) seem to have disappeared during the intervening period. One of the species found for the first time in November 1998, Southern Banded Snake Eagle Circaetus fasciolatus, is of global conservation concern. A further 10 of the 268 species recorded are regarded as locally threatened in southern Mocambique. Five of these (Ostrich, Hooded Vulture, Crowned Crane Balearica regulorum, Lesser Jacana Microparra capensis and Pel's Fishing Owl Scotopelia peli) have not been found during recent surveys and are priority candidates for more detailed investigation. The records of one of the locally threatened species found for the first time in November 1998, Mangrove Kingfisher Halcyon senegaloides, are of particular interest in the light of current controversy as to its migratory patterns. The middle Save River valley lies within a global Endemic Bird Area and two species with globally restricted ranges occur in the region: Pink-throated Twinspot Hypargos margaritatus and Lemon-breasted Canary Serinus citrinipectus. The densities of large diurnal birds of prey were found to be surprisingly high.},

@article{Hockey2000,
abstract = {The common mode of migration among Afrotropical birds is movement from tropical to temperate areas to breed usually coinciding with the onset of summer and the rainy season. The proportion of species that are migratory can be predicted with considerable accuracy from the average temperature of the coldest month of the year. Once this exceeds 20°C, 90% or more of breeding species will be non-migratory. The likelihood of any one species being migratory is strongly influenced by diet, foraging mode as influenced by the behaviour of prey and vegetation geography. Insectivores are disproportionately well represented among the migrants whereas, at the other extreme, frugivores are almost exclusively sedentary. Within the insectivore guild, the greatest migratory tendencies are found among those groups that exclusively hunt aerial insects above the canopy (e.g. swallows, swifts and nightjars), perch-hunters that depend on large, active insect prey (e.g. halcyonid kingfishers and rollers) and taxa heavily dependent on the larvae of flying insects (cuckoos). Insectivores that hunt or glean small invertebrates (volant or not) within the canopy or glean relatively sessile prey from the ground are much less likely to be migratory. This gradient, linking prey attributes and hunting behaviour to migratory behaviour, is probably mediated by a parallel gradient in seasonal prey availability. In marked contrast to the Neotropics and the Orient, many Afrotropical birds undertake polarised migrations, with part of the population moving north, and part south, of the tropics. The explanation of this is hypothesised to lie in the spatial symmetry and large extent of savannas both north and south of the tropics, coupled with a lack of north-south dispersal barriers. These conditions are not replicated in either the Neotropics or the Orient.},

abstract = {A preference for bushy evergreen undergrowth determines both the local and the general distribution of Cossypha natalensis. The lack of such undergrowth makes equatorial rain‐forests unsuitable. Tropical and subtropical evergreen forests provide excellent conditions from this point of view, and they are thus the main habitat type from which C. natalensis has secondarily extended into tropical and subtropical deciduous forests with evergreen undergrowth. Adult birds remain in or close to their territories throughout the year. First‐year birds undertake longer movements during the winter. Breeding territories are relatively small, from 2,500 up to (exceptionally) 10,000 square yards (2,100‐8,400 sq. m). Breeding begins in October. Both sexes build the nest, but only the female incubates. In southern Africa there is one brood a year, and the care of the offspring is protracted. The juvenile moult begins in the third and ends in the sixth month; adults have only one (post‐breeding) moult a year. The begging behaviour of the young is somewhat different from that of most other turdine birds, and is considered to be more primitive. The ontogeny of the adult displays is described as observed in young birds kept in captivity. The development of vocal behaviour is described. Special attention is given to the different functional forms of the song, and to two of its special features, imitation and a tonal quality termed vox humana.

In one of the first studies leveraging geolocators to uncover intra-African bird migration, we propose to investigate the specific migration patterns of two species: the Mangrove Kingfisher and the Red-capped Robin-chat. Beyond the description of migratory patterns in terms of timing and route, we will investigate the speed and rhythm of the Mangrove Kingfisher's migration, and reveal the location of breeding grounds of Red-capped Robin-chat populations that spend the non-breeding season along the coast of Kenya. We plan to equip individuals from these two species with geolocators on the coast of Kenya, and retrap them in the following years, in order to collect and subsequently analyse data on their migration strategy. These data will be combined with ringing data and citizen science bird atlas data to provide a detailed picture of these two species' migration in East Africa.},

abstract = {Global climate warming, now conclusively linked to anthropogenically-increased CO2 levels in the earth's atmosphere, has already had impacts on the earth's biodiversity and is predicted to threaten more than 1 million species with extinction by 2050. Climate change in southern Africa is expected to involve higher temperatures and lower rainfall, with less predictability and a greater frequency of severe storms, fires and El Ni{\~{n}}o events. The predicted changes to birds in Africa — the continent most at risk from climate change — have hardly been explored, yet birds and many other vertebrates face uncertain futures. Here, in one of the first focused analyses of the correlates of climate change vulnerability in southern African birds, we offer a wide-ranging perspective on which species may be most at risk, and explore which traits may influence the adaptability or extinction risk of bird species. Our review suggests that small nomadic species with short generation times may be least at risk. While larger-bodied species may be physiologically buffered against environmental change, their longer generation times may make them less able to adapt evolutionarily to climate change. Migrant species, and those with specialised feeding niches such as pollinators, are also predicted to be at risk of population declines, based on low ability to adapt to new environments when introduced there as aliens. Species with small ranges (<50 000km) restricted to the two southern African biodiversity hotspots most at risk from climate change — the Cape Floral Kingdom and the Succulent Karoo — are ranked according to low, medium or high risk of extinction. Those restricted to mountain slopes, mountain tops or islands, and those occurring mainly at the southern or western extremes of these biomes, are ranked as highest risk. These include endemic sunbirds, warblers and rock-jumpers — none of which are currently recognised Red Data species. Using climate envelopes we modelled the possible range shifts by 2050 of three pairs of species found in habitats considered to be at risk: fynbos, mountain and arid Karoo. All six species lost substantial portions of their range (x = 40%), with the montane Drakensberg Rock-jumper Chaetops aurantius losing most (69%). Significant reductions of available climate space in all species may interact with life history characteristics to threaten many southern African bird species unable to shift geographic range or adapt to novel resource conditions. We conclude with a list of research priorities and testable hypotheses which may advance our understanding of the complex influence that climate change is likely to have on African, particularly southern African, birds. {\textcopyright} 2004 NISC Pty Ltd.},

abstract = {Long-term bird-banding programs provide knowledge of the demographic rates of avian populations, but we currently lack information on demographic rates of most bird populations in species-rich tropical ecosystems. Banding in tropical regions is typically conducted with protracted or irregular sampling occasions that make the choice of the proper capture-mark-recapture (CMR) model diffcult. Here, we address common challenges related to collecting and analyzing data to estimate survival rates of resident Neotropical birds using 20 years of banding efforts in Mexico as a case study. We applied Cormack-Jolly-Seber and Barker models to estimate apparent survival and recapture probabilities of species with sufficient data for survival analyses. We were able to analyze 6 resident species of 136 total species; apparent survival probabilities ranged from 0.30 to 0.77, and recapture probabilities from 0.11 to 0.52. For monitoring programs with existing data collected at continuous, uneven, or irregular intervals, we recommend the application of the Barker model over other models because it was more efficient in the use of available banding data and less often violated CMR assumptions. We recommend that monitoring programs last >10 years and provide additional protocol suggestions for primary and secondary sampling occasions, as well as the number of nets, potential net configurations, and the extent of the spatial scale. These baseline recommendations are likely to foster an increase in our knowledge of avian survival rates in tropical ecosystems, which is imperative for managing tropical bird populations under changing environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} The American Ornithologists' Union, 2012.

Because climate change patterns are not uniform across the globe, we can expect regional disparities in bird phenological responses. It is also likely that they vary across species, as species show differences in the strength of affinities they have with particular habitats and environments. Here, we examine the arrival and departure of nine Palearctic and seven intra-African migratory species in the central Highveld of South Africa, where the former spend their nonbreeding season and the latter their breeding season. Using novel analytical methods based on bird atlas data, we show phenological shifts in migration of five species - red-backed shrike, spotted flycatcher, common sandpiper, white-winged tern (Palearctic migrants), and diederik cuckoo (intra-African migrant) - between two atlas periods: 1987-1991 and 2007-2012. During this time period, Palearctic migrants advanced their departure from their South African nonbreeding grounds. This trend was mainly driven by waterbirds. No consistent changes were observed for intra-African migrants. Our results suggest that the most consistent drivers of migration phenological shifts act in the northern hemisphere, probably at the breeding grounds.},

We incorporate these factors into a detection and treatment model of a low-density invader to determine the surveillance strategy that minimizes expected management costs. Sites with a high probability of invader occurrence and great benefits associated with detection warrant intensive surveillance; however, the optimum investment is a nonlinear function of these factors. Environments where the invader is relatively easy to detect are prioritized for surveillance, although only a moderate investment is necessary to ensure a high probability of detection. Intensive surveillance effort may be allocated to other sites if the probability of occurrence, budget and/or expected benefits is sufficiently high. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Each year, billions of songbirds cross large ecological barriers during their migration. Understanding how they perform this incredible task is crucial to predict how global change may threaten the safety of such journeys. Earlier studies based on radar suggested that most songbirds cross deserts in intermittent flights at high altitude, stopping in the desert during the day, while recent tracking with light loggers suggested diurnal prolongation of nocturnal flights and common non-stop flights for some species. We analyzed light intensity and temperature data obtained from geolocation loggers deployed on 130 individuals of ten migratory songbird species, and show that a large variety of strategies for crossing deserts exists between, but also sometimes within species. Diurnal stopover in the desert is a common strategy in autumn, while most species prolonged some nocturnal flights into the day. Non-stop flights over the desert occurred more frequently in spring than in autumn, and more frequently in foliage gleaners. Temperature recordings suggest that songbirds crossed deserts with flight bouts performed at various altitudes according to species and season, along a gradient ranging from low above ground in autumn to probably >2000 m above ground level, and possibly at higher altitude in spring. High-altitude flights are therefore not the general rule for crossing deserts in migrant songbirds. We conclude that a diversity of migration strategies exists for desert crossing among songbirds, with variations between but also within species.},

abstract = {Previous studies that optimize allocation of surveillance resources over space have assumed that detection rates are constant over time and that travel or survey costs are the same for all sites. Other recent research explicitly accounts for stochastically varying detection rates and distinct travel costs but restricts attention to the optimal number of visits to a single site. Here, we integrate these approaches to construct a model that optimizes the allocation of surveillance effort over both space and time. The solution defines the budget that should be allocated to each site and the number of visits over which that search budget should be expended. We show that the solution has close affinities with that of Hauser and McCarthy (Ecology Letters, 12, 2009, 683), which ignored temporal variation in detection rates and travel costs. We illustrate our approach by finding the optimal allocation of survey effort over space and time that maximizes the expected number of detections of the cascade treefrog (Litoria pearsoniana) in a region. In deriving our model, we also solve an alternative model to Moore et al. (PLoS One, 9, 2014) that considers the trade-off between the number of visits and length of each visit when the detection rate at a site varies over time. We compare the predictions of the original model of Moore et al. (PLoS One, 9, 2014) and the new model using experimental data on detections of two species, showing the two models perform similarly well. Interestingly, when variable detection rates and travel costs are considered using our model, the form of the resulting objective function is very similar to the case in which they are ignored; in both cases, the probability of failed detection at each site is a negative exponential function of effort. However, travel costs impose a discontinuity into the solution space making the decision variables semi-continuous (i.e. the optimal surveillance effort at each site is either zero or a value greater than the travel cost). This discontinuity complicates the task of finding the optimal solution. We propose a straightforward algorithm that finds very good approximate solutions.},

abstract = {In their 2015 Current Biology paper, Streby et al. [1] reported that Golden-winged Warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera), which had just migrated to their breeding location in eastern Tennessee, performed a facultative and up to “>1,500 km roundtrip” to the Gulf of Mexico to avoid a severe tornadic storm. From light-level geolocator data, wherein geographical locations are estimated via the timing of sunrise and sunset, Streby et al. [1] concluded that the warblers had evacuated their breeding area approximately 24 hours before the storm and returned about five days later. The authors presented this finding as evidence that migratory birds avoid severe storms by temporarily moving long-distances. However, the tracking method employed by Streby et al. [1] is prone to considerable error and uncertainty. Here, we argue that this interpretation of the data oversteps the limits of the used tracking technique. By calculating the expected geographical error range for the tracked birds, we demonstrate that the hypothesized movements fell well within the geolocators' inherent error range for this species and that such deviations in latitude occur frequently even if individuals remain stationary. Lisovski et al. respond to a Current Biology paper by Streby et al. on small migratory bird moving long distances to avoid a tornado hitting their breeding grounds and show that the reported locations during this evacuation movement cannot be disentangled from the inherent error of the used tracking technique.},

abstract = {Avian migration has been shown to be a life history strategy for surviving environmental resource variability, but it requires increased body reserves for long distance flight. Fat reserves make excellent energy stores for barrier crossing, whereas proteins generate less energy for the same mass of fat but provide water during breakdown which may become especially useful when birds become water stressed. Intra-African migrants are probably unlikely to have to cross barriers equivalent to the Sahara and the Mediterranean and so may have different patterns of mass reserves reflecting the utility of metabolizing fat versus protein in hot, tropical environments. We examined differences in proportions of body mass gain, pectoral muscle score and fat score between intra African migrants, Palearctic migrants and resident African species. We tested whether intra-African migrants show a distinct seasonal peak in mass gain corresponding to expected peak migration period in a manner similar to Palearctic migrants, but maintain larger muscle tissues, because Palearctic migrants are more constrained by a need to heavily up regulate fat in addition to fat free reserves before migration due to the energy requirements of crossing the barrier of the Sahara. We found that intra-African migrants had a peak seasonal mass gain similar to Palearctics whereas African residents did not, and that Palearctics increased fat reserves with pectoral muscle reserves, so that they had much higher fat scores for any given level of pectoral muscle compared to intra-African migrants or resident species. Our results suggest that barrier crossing leads to a distinct increase in fat reserves rather than migration per se, and suggests that intra-African migrants are more similar in their reserve management to African residents. Mass gain devoid of visible fat accumulation in intra-African migrants may therefore suggest absence of barriers during migration.},

abstract = {Over decades it has been unclear how individual migratory songbirds\ncross large ecological barriers such as seas or deserts. By deploying\nlight-level geolocators on four songbird species weighing only about 12\ng, we found that these otherwise mainly nocturnal migrants seem to\nregularly extend their nocturnal flights into the day when crossing the\nSahara Desert and the Mediterranean Sea. The proportion of the proposed\ndiurnally flying birds gradually declined over the day with similar\nlanding patterns in autumn and spring. The prolonged flights were\nslightly more frequent in spring than in autumn, suggesting tighter\nmigratory schedules when returning to breeding sites. Often we found\nseveral patterns for barrier crossing for the same individual in autumn\ncompared to the spring journey. As only a small proportion of the birds\nflew strictly during the night and even some individuals might have\nflown nonstop, we suggest that prolonged endurance flights are not an\nexception even in small migratory species.

abstract = {The temporal and spatial organization of the annual cycle according to local conditions is of crucial importance for individuals' fitness. Moreover, which sites and when particular sites are used can have profound consequences especially for migratory animals, because the two factors shape interactions within and between populations, as well as between animal and the environment. Here, we compare spatial and temporal patterns of two latitudinally separated breeding populations of a trans-Equatorial passerine migrant, the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis, throughout the annual cycle. We found that migration routes and non-breeding residency areas of the two populations largely overlapped. Due to climatic constraints, however, the onset of breeding in the northern population was approximately two weeks later than that of the southern population. We demonstrate that this temporal offset between the populations carries-over from breeding to the entire annual cycle. The northern population was consistently later in timing of all subsequent annual events - autumn migration, non-breeding residence period, spring migration and the following breeding. Such year-round spatiotemporal patterns suggest that annual schedules are endogenously controlled with breeding latitude as the decisive element pre-determining the timing of annual events in our study populations.},

abstract = {Annual movements have been widely described for birds migrating across the Americas and between Eurasia and Africa, yet relatively little information exists for intra-African migrants. Identifying the areas used throughout a species annual cycle by understanding migratory patterns and settlement areas during breeding and non-breeding seasons is essential for conservation initiatives. Here, we describe for the first time, the migratory patterns and settlement areas of an endangered raptor endemic to Southern Africa, the Black Harrier (Circus maurus). From 2008 to 2015, thirteen breeding adult Black Harriers were trapped in south-western South Africa and fitted either with a GPS-GSM or with a PTT tracker device. Adults were monitored for 365 ± 198 days (range: 56–819 days) revealing great individual variability in annual movements. Most Black Harriers performed an unusual West-East migration from their breeding areas, but routes of all migrating individuals covered the entire southern land area of South Africa and Lesotho. The distance travelled averaged 814 ± 324 km, but unlike many other species, migrants travelled faster during post-breeding (i.e. austral summer) (207.8 ± 113.2 km.day -1 ) than during pre-breeding (i.e. austral winter/spring) migrations (143.8 ± 32.2 km.day -1 ). Although most marked individuals displayed movements similar to those that bred following pre-breeding migrations, only two of thirteen were confirmed as breeders the year after being tagged. This suggests that individuals may sometimes take a sabbatical year in reproduction, although this requires confirmation. Most tagged birds died on migration or during the non-breeding season. Adults frequently returned to the same non-breeding settlement areas, and often used up to 3 different locations an average of about 200 km apart. On the other hand, there was wide variation in distance between subsequent reproductive events. We discuss the implications of our study for the conservation of Black Harriers and more broadly for intra-African bird migrants.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a satellite tracking study of seven adult Abdim's Storks Ciconia abdimii that were followed from the nesting areas in southern Niger across the equator to the non-breeding range and back. Post-breeding migration started between early November and early December when all birds migrated directly to an area south of Lake Victoria in Tanzania, where they arrived between late November and early January. One bird moved to Zimbabwe for 2.5 months before returning to Tanzania; this bird returned to the same place in Zimbabwe the following year. The other tagged storks remained in northern Tanzania, suggesting that this region (at least in 2003–2004) is more important as a wintering area for the species than previously thought. While in Tanzania and Zimbabwe, most storks were almost completely stationary. Prenuptial migration started during mid-February, when one stork moved to the Central African Republic (CAR). The other storks moved to northern Uganda in mid-March and four continued into southern Sudan in mid-April, following the progression of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Final migration towards Niger started between early April and early May, when the storks returned to the nests of the previous year in mid-May, almost simultaneously with the first major rainfall. Storks from the same village differed widely in migration strategy. Post-breeding maximum migration speed was between 216km/day and 307km/day, while migration was generally faster on the last leg of the return trip to the nest, with a maximum of 456km/day. {\textcopyright} 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

But risks to migrating birds from artificial light are not spatially or temporally uniform, representing a challenge for mitigating potential hazards and developing action plans to catalog risks at continental scales. We leveraged over two decades of remote-sensing data collected by weather surveillance radar and satellite-based sensors to identify locations and times of year when the highest numbers of migrating birds are exposed to light pollution in the contiguous US. Our continental-scale quantification of light exposure provides a novel opportunity for dynamic and targeted conservation strategies to address the hazards posed by light pollution to nocturnally migrating birds.},

abstract = {Template-fit geolocation offers an opportunity to estimate error in each individual day's position results. The estimate requires determining an empirical calibration constant for latitude and another for longitude based on a trial against realistic noise in irradiance field data, which typically display strong point-to-point correlations. Such a calibration is reported here, making the error estimate available for use. The calibration is based on a 458-day set of blue-light irradiance data taken by an archival tag (Lotek LTD750) at a known location on land (48.57°N, 122.94°W). For the data studied, median values of the estimated daily standard deviations were 0.42° in longitude, 0.95° in latitude. The error estimates include the effects of weather and other data noise, latitude, and season, so (1) they vary widely from day to day and with season, and (2) they can be cautiously expected to remain valid in situations other than the particular one tested. A change in the character of the data noise is the only factor expected to have a significant effect on the calibration; this work should be repeated to sample the expected range of data noise types. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In order to maximise breeding success in a seasonally fluctuating environment animals breed during periods of increased resource abundance and avoid times of resource constraint. In tropical savannahs, variation in resources in time and space is dependent on the amplitude of the rains and their predictability. We quantified the degree to which tropical savannah birds have concentrated their breeding around predicted periods of increased food availability coincident with rainfall. We used the proportion of adults caught with brood patches and/or the juvenile-to-adult ratio in 25 species of small savannah bird which were caught over a 10-year period in Nigeria, West Africa, to assess the degree to which there were clear seasonal peaks in breeding activity. We found two-thirds of species bred in all seasons (68 %), but that most species showed distinct seasonal peaks (96 %) in the timing of their breeding. Over one-half of species (60 %) varied the timing of their breeding across the years. Granivorous species bred later than insectivorous and frugivorous species, which probably indicates synchronisation with their respective peak abundance in food type. Overall we found distinct seasonal peaks in breeding effort (i.e. breeding seasons), and this is most likely in response to changing resource availability brought about by seasonal rainfall. We also demonstrated the potential utility of using brood patches to test for patterns in breeding in multi-species long-term datasets. {\textcopyright} 2013 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.},

abstract = {A new analysis of twilight predicts that for observations made in narrow-band blue light, the shape of the light curve (irradiance vs. sun elevation angle) between +3 and –5° (87 to 95° zenith angle) has a particular rigid shape not significantly affected by cloudi- ness, horizon details, atmospheric refraction or atmospheric dust loading. This shape is dis- tinctive, can be located reliably in measured data, and provides a firm theoretical basis for animal geolocation by template-fitting to irradiance data. The resulting approach matches a theoretical model of the irradiance vs. time-of-day to the relevant portion of a given day's data, adjusting parameters for latitude, longitude, and cloudiness. In favorable cases, there is only one parameter choice that will fit well, and that choice becomes the position estimate. The entire process can proceed automatically in a tag. Theoretical estimates predict good accuracy over most of the year and most of the earth, with difficulties just on the winter side of equinox and near the equator. Polar regions are favorable whenever the sun crosses –5° to +3° elevation, and the method can yield useful results whenever the sun makes a significant excursion into that elevation range. Early results based on data taken on land at 48°N latitude confirm the predictions vs. season, and show promising},

Ostrich 66: 135-140. An adult female Wahlberg's Eagle from northern Namibia was tracked by satellite over a total distance of 8816 km and located 104 times between 11 February and 4 November 1994. It migrated on an almost due north heading to northern Cameroon, north-eastern Nigeria and western Chad through the rain forest belt of the Congo and Zaire after the breeding season. The total trans-equatorial distance between the breeding and non-breeding ranges was 3520 km. During the non-breeding season the bird ranged over a large area (ca. 60 000 km2) for about six weeks (29 April - 14 June) in these three countries in a rather nomadic pattern covering a minimum distance of 1256 km. During two further months (14 June - 14 August) it restricted its movements to an area of about 5000 km2 near Maiduguri in the Sudan savannah of north-eastern Nigeria. The return migration took about two weeks longer than that to the north, which took about a month. {\textcopyright} 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Access to reliable population data is crucial for effective conservation and management of birds. So far, relatively little attention has been paid to assessing and monitoring bird populations in Africa. This is beginning to change. Regional meetings, for example in East Africa, are discussing and defining standard methodologies, and making technical information more widely available. Researchers are using these methods to access the populations of threatened species, or those of economic value. Projects involving long-term monitoring, particularly of waterbirds, are beginning to yield results that are useful for management. Some challenges that remain include: securing institutional and financial support for long-term monitoring work; integrating monitoring efforts (especially of migratory species) across borders; understanding the ecological significance of population trends; finding robust and reliable methods to census economically important species, such as game-birds; and making accurate global assessments of the populations of threatened species. {\textcopyright} 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

@article{Elgood1973,
abstract = {Owing to the regular alternation of wet and dry seasons and to the relatively simple arrangement of vegetation zones, migration is a well‐developed phenomenon in the northern tropics of Africa. Nigeria is well placed for its study. While a vast amount remains to be learned, a systematic treatment of the 672 Nigerian bird species shows that at least 126 of them are migrant. Species newly shown to be migratory include the sunbird Nectarinia pulchella, the bunting Fringillaria (Emberiza) tahapisi, and the sparrow Gymnoris (Petronia) dentata, and corroborative evidence is adduced for many more. New interpretations are placed on the movements of the bustard Neotis denhami, the Painted Snipe Rostratula benghalensis, and other species. Most families that are migrant in the temperate zone (e.g. storks, cuckoos, nightjars, hirundines) have several migrants among their tropical representatives, except flycatchers, thrushes, warblers and shrikes. Important tropical migrant families include the kingfishers and sunbirds. The following ecological correlates emerge: migration appears to be more important at lower than higher trophic levels in the ecosystem; only one primary lowland rain forest and one montane forest species migrate; 95% of African migrants in Nigeria inhabit the five savanna zones, where the 120 migrants comprise 28% of the avifauna; most savanna migrants cross one, two or three vegetation zone boundaries; few are restricted within a single zone or cross four boundaries; twice as many savanna species are eurytopic (habitat‐tolerant) as stenotopic (habitat‐tied), and twice the proportion of eurytopic as stenotopic species are migrant; the majority of migrants move so as to avoid the winter drought in northern Nigeria (insectivores being little affected) and also the heaviest summer rains in southern savannas; migration is initiated by climatic factors such as rains, dry desert winds, etc. Three to six Nigerian species cross the Equator, but the stork Anastomus lamelligerus is shown to breed in Nigeria and the Chad basin and may not be a trans‐equatorial migrant. A quail, a crake, a coucal and five cuckoos have space‐time distribution patterns (motograms) in Nigeria that suggest equatorial migration. Motograms figured for 60 species show great variation. Nearly all land‐bird migrants move with the progression of the sun and the inter‐tropical front, north in spring and south in autumn. The basic pattern is thus a summer wet‐season range at higher latitude than the winter dry‐season range, and specific patterns vary according to the absolute and relative latitudinal limits af each season, and to speed and dates of migration. Comparison of congeneric migrants having different breeding seasons or motogram patterns suggests that a specific migration pattern is fixed by ecological necessity, and reproduction occurs at that time in the year when the species is stationary longest. Breeding seasons may span migration periods, leading to two‐stage early‐rains migration in e.g. the kingfisher Halcyon leucocephala. Water‐bird migrations are complicated by opportunist breeding and responses to floods and changing water levels in rivers. A few species move with the typical land‐bird pattern; others concentrate at perennial marshes in arid northern savannas, and may disperse in all directions from the few west African breeding stations.

abstract = {1. Geolocation by light allows for tracking animal movements, based on measurements of light intensity over time by a data-logging device ('geolocator'). Recent developments of ultra-light devices (<2g) broadened the range of target species and boosted the number of studies using geolocators. However, an inherent problem of geolocators is that any factor or process that changes the natural light intensity pattern also affects the positions calculated from these light patterns. Although the most important factors have been identified, estimation of their effect on the accuracy and precision of positions estimated has been lacking but is very important for the analyses and interpretation of geolocator data. 2.The 'threshold method' is mainly used to derive positions by defining sunrise and sunset times from the light intensity pattern for each recorded day. This method requires calibration: a predefined sun elevation angle for estimating latitude by fitting the recorded day/night lengths to theoretical values across latitudes. Therewith, almost constant shading can be corrected for by finding the appropriate sun elevation angle. 3.Weather, topography and vegetation are the most important factors that influence light intensities. We demonstrated their effect on the measurement of day/night length, time of solar midnight/noon and the resulting position estimates using light measurements from stationary geolocators at known places and from geolocators mounted on birds. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of different calibration methods on the accuracy of the latitudinal positions. 4.All three environmental factors can influence the light intensity pattern significantly. Weather and an animal's behaviour result in increased noise in positioning, whereas topography and vegetation result in systematic shading and biased positions. Calibration can significantly shift the estimated latitudes and potentially increase the accuracy, but detailed knowledge about the particular confounding factors and the behaviour of the studied animal is crucial for the choice of the most appropriate calibration method. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {We investigated sex- and year-dependent variation in the temporal and spatial movement pattern of barn swallows Hirundo rustica during the non-breeding period. Hundred and three individuals equipped with miniaturized light-level geolocators at three different breeding areas in southern Switzerland and northern Italy provided data for the analysis. We identified a region 1000 km in radius centred in Cameroon as the main non-breeding residence area of these three geographical populations. Five residence areas of males only were in southern Africa, south of 19°S. Most individuals occupied a single site during their stay south of the Sahara. The timing of migration broadly overlapped between sexes and all geographical breeding populations. Between the two study years there was a distinct difference of 5 to 10 d in departure dates from and arrival at the breeding sites. Remarkably, the period of residence in sub-Saharan Africa was very similar (157 d) in the two study years, but their positions in the first year (2010-2011) were about 400 km more to the north than in the second (2011-2012). Independent of the year, individuals with sub-Saharan residence areas further north and east had a shorter pre-breeding migration and arrived earlier than those staying further south and west. In addition, birds breeding in southern Switzerland arrived at their breeding colony 7-10 d later than those breeding only 100 km south, in the Po river plain. Our study provides new information on the variance in migration phenology and the distribution of residence areas in sub-Saharan Africa in relation to sex, population and year. It supports the usefulness of light-level geolocators for the study of annual routines of large samples of small birds.},

Food limitation forces the large adult males and small, young females to migrate, contrary to the expectations of the body size and dominance hypotheses. This study confirms the importance of food variability as the primary driver of migratory behaviour.

abstract = {In 2007, the first miniature light-level geolocators were deployed on small landbirds, revolutionizing the study of migration. In this paper, we review studies that have used geolocators to track small landbirds with the goal of summarizing research themes and identifying remaining important gaps in understanding. We also highlight research and opportunities using 2 recently developed tracking technologies: archival GPS tags and automated radio-telemetry systems. In our review, we found that most (54%) geolocator studies focused on quantifying natural history of migration, such as identifying migration routes, nonbreeding range, and migration timing. Studies of behavioral ecology (20%) uncovered proximate drivers of movements, including en route habitat quality; that migration routes, but not timing, may be flexible in some species; and different age and sex classes show significant differences in migration strategy. Studies of the evolution of migration (9%) have illustrated that migration is a potential barrier to hybridizing species or subspecies, and some work has correlated gene polymorphisms and methylation patterns with migration behavior. Studies of migratory connectivity (11%) have shown that a moderate level of connectivity is common, although variability across and within species exists. Studies of seasonal interactions (7%) have found mixed results: in some cases, carryover effects have been identified; in other cases, carryover effects are buffered during intervening stages of the annual cycle. Archival GPS tags provide unprecedented precision in locations of nonbreeding sites and migration routes, and will continue to improve understanding of migration across large spatial scales. Automated radio-telemetry systems are revolutionizing our knowledge of migratory stopover biology, and have led to discoveries of previously unknown stopover behaviors. Together, these tracking technologies will continue to provide insight into small migratory landbird movements and contribute important information for conservation of this rapidly declining group.},

Some birds may be especially susceptible to increased rainfall seasonality and to extreme weather events, such as heat waves, cold spells, and tropical cyclones. Birds that experience limited temperature variation and have low basal metabolic rates will be the most prone to the physiological effects of warming temperatures and heat waves. Mostly unknown species' interactions, indirect effects, and synergies of climate change with other threats, such as habitat loss, emerging diseases, invasive species, and hunting will exacerbate the effects of climate change on tropical birds. In some models habitat loss can increase bird extinctions caused by climate change by 50%. 3.5. °C surface warming by the year 2100 may result in 600-900 extinctions of land bird species, 89% of which occur in the tropics. Depending on the amount of future habitat loss, each degree of surface warming could lead to approximately 100-500 additional bird extinctions. Protected areas will be more important than ever, but they need to be designed with climate change in mind. Although 92% of currently protected areas are likely to become climatically unsuitable in a century, for example only 7 or 8 priority species' preferred climatic envelopes are projected to be entirely lost from the African Important Bird Area network. Networks of protected areas need to incorporate extensive topographical diversity, cover wide elevational ranges, have high connectivity, and integrate human-dominated landscapes into conservation schemes. Most tropical bird species vulnerable to climate change are not currently considered threatened with extinction, often due to lack of knowledge; systematically and regularly gathering information on the ecology, and current and future distributions of these species is an urgent priority. Locally based, long-term tropical bird monitoring and conservation programs based on adaptive management are essential to help protect birds against climate change. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Aim Assessing the extent of large-scale migratory connectivity is crucial for understanding the evolution of migratory systems and effective species conservation. It has been, however, difficult to elucidate the annual whereabouts of migratory populations of small animals across the annual cycle. Here, we use the reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) as one of the most frequently ringed passerines in Europe to demonstrate how ring re-encounter and geolocator data can be used to effectively quantify range-wide distribution of different populations. Location Birds were ringed across Europe and re-encountered in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Methods We employed multistate models which quantify range-wide distribution of different breeding populations while accounting for the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the re-encounter probabilities and differential age-specific survival during migratory and non-migratory periods. In addition, we integrated geolocator and breeding abundance data as well as human population density to provide a realistic picture of the year-round distribution of the reed warbler, a trans-Saharan migrant. Results Our modelling approach revealed frequent use of the western Mediterranean flyway for the majority of western European populations, but a higher absolute number of reed warblers used the eastern flyway. Further, many populations used different stopover areas during post- and pre-breeding migration, resulting in an anticlockwise loop migration pattern. Main conclusions The integrative modelling framework helped us to depict the range-wide migration pattern more realistically than raw ring re-encounter data would allow.},

abstract = {Longevity and displacement records aid in the understanding of animal senescence and the possible range of a species. Within wild populations this information is infrequent with most longevity reports being based on captive individuals and displacements being calculated from few monitored individuals within the population. Ringing offers a means of calculating these values and for avian species SAFRING and other bird ringing schemes are critically important. As many vulture populations are under threat, it has become ever more important to analyse all aspects of their demography to understand what can be done to aid the conservation of these species. Southern Africa's eight vulture species are almost all listed as globally threatened and as a result many studies incorporate this ringing information. This has allowed for longevity records to be calculated for most of the species with the Cape Vulture obtaining the greatest reported longevity of 31 years 2 months and 14 days. In addition to the longevity records, ringing also produces maximum displacement records with the greatest vulture displacement being 2 530 km (White-backed Vulture). Although vulture ringing effort has improved in recent years very few new longevity records appear to be produced with most recent recoveries being under 10 years.},

abstract = {Aim The extent to which individuals from different breeding populations mix throughout the non-breeding season (i.e. ‘migratory connectivity') has important consequences for population dynamics and conservation. Given recent declines of long-distance migrant birds, multipopulation tracking studies are crucial in order to assess the strength of migratory connectivity and to identify key sites en route. Here, we present the first large-scale analysis of migration patterns and migratory connectivity in the globally near-threatened European roller Coracias garrulus. Location Breeding area: Europe; passage area: Mediterranean, sub-Saharan Africa, Arabian Peninsula; wintering area: southern Africa. Methods We synthesize new geolocator data with existing geolocator, satellite tag and ring recovery data from eight countries across Europe. We describe routes and stopover sites, analyse the spatial pattern of winter sites with respect to breeding origin and quantify the strength of connectivity between breeding and winter sites. Results We demonstrate the importance of the northern savanna zone as a stopover region and reveal the easterly spring loop (via Arabia) and leapfrog migration of rollers from eastern populations. Whilst there was some overlap between individuals from different populations over winter, their distribution was non-random, with positive correlations between breeding and autumn/winter longitude as well as between pairwise distance matrices of breeding and winter sites. Connectivity was stronger for eastern populations than western ones. Main conclusions The moderate levels of connectivity detected here may increase the resilience of breeding populations to localized habitat loss on the winter quarters. We also highlight the passage regions crucial for the successful conservation of roller populations, including the Sahel/Sudan savanna for all populations, and the Horn of Africa/Arabian Peninsula for north-eastern rollers.},

abstract = {Background: Geolocators are useful for tracking movements of long-distance migrants, but potential negative effects on birds have not been well studied. We tested for effects of geolocators (0.8-2.0 g total, representing 0.1- 3.9 % of mean body mass) on 16 species of migratory shorebirds, including five species with 2-4 subspecies each for a total of 23 study taxa. Study species spanned a range of body sizes (26-1091 g) and eight genera, and were tagged at 23 breeding and eight nonbreeding sites. We compared breeding performance and return rates of birds with geolocators to control groups while controlling for potential confounding variables. Results: We detected negative effects of tags for three small-bodied species. Geolocators reduced annual return rates for two of 23 taxa: by 63 % for semipalmated sandpipers and by 43 % for the arcticola subspecies of dunlin. High resighting effort for geolocator birds could have masked additional negative effects. Geolocators were more likely to negatively affect return rates if the total mass of geolocators and color markers was 2.5-5.8 % of body mass than if tags were 0.3-2.3 % of body mass. Carrying a geolocator reduced nest success by 42 % for semipalmated sandpipers and tripled the probability of partial clutch failure in semipalmated and western sandpipers. Geolocators mounted perpendicular to the leg on a flag had stronger negative effects on nest success than geolocators mounted parallel to the leg on a band. However, parallel-band geolocators were more likely to reduce return rates and cause injuries to the leg. No effects of geolocators were found on breeding movements or changes in body mass. Among-site variation in geolocator effect size was high, suggesting that local factors were important. Conclusions: Negative effects of geolocators occurred only for three of the smallest species in our dataset, but were substantial when present. Future studies could mitigate impacts of tags by reducing protruding parts and minimizing use of additional markers. Investigators could maximize recovery of tags by strategically deploying geolocators on males, previously marked individuals, and successful breeders, though targeting subsets of a population could bias the resulting migratory movement data in some species.},

abstract = {Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) breeding at inland lakes in North America have experienced significant population declines since the 1960s. Although management actions aimed at mitigating effects of habitat loss and predation have been largely effective, numbers continue to decline, which suggests that the population may be limited during the nonbreeding season. Between 2013 and 2015, we used light-level geolocators to track Common Terns nesting at 5 inland colonies--from Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada, to the eastern Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada--to identify migratory routes and stopover and wintering sites and to determine the strength of migratory connectivity among colonies. Within 46 recovered tracks, we found evidence of a longitudinal gradient in use of migration routes and stopover sites among colonies and identified major staging areas in the lower Great Lakes and at inland and coastal locations along the Atlantic coast, Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico. Low migratory connectivity across inland colonies illustrates high intermixing within wintering sites, with many birds spending the nonbreeding season in Peru (70%) and the remainder spread throughout the Gulf of Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America. While the large spatial spread and intermixing of individuals during the nonbreeding season may buffer local effects of climate change and human disturbance, the aggregation of individuals along the coast of Peru could make them vulnerable to events or changes within this region, such as increased frequency and intensity of storms in the Pacific, that are predicted to negatively influence breeding productivity and survival of Common Terns. Identifying sources of mortality during the nonbreeding season, quantifying winter site fidelity, and reinforcing the importance of continued management of inland breeding colonies are vital priorities for effective conservation and management of this vulnerable population.},

abstract = {Across their ranges, different populations of migratory species often use separate routes to migrate between breeding and non-breeding grounds. Recent changes in climate and land-use have led to breeding range expansions in many species but it is unclear whether these populations also establish new migratory routes, non-breeding sites and migration phenology. Thus, we compared the migration patterns of European Bee-eaters Merops apiaster from two established western (n = 5) and eastern (n = 6) breeding populations in Europe, with those from a newly founded northern population (n = 19). We aimed to relate the breeding populations to the two known non-breeding clusters in Africa, and to test for similarities of migration routes and timing between the old and new populations. Western Bee-eaters used the western flyway to destinations in West Africa; the eastern birds uniformly headed south to southern African non-breeding sites, confirming a complete separation in time and space between these long-established populations. The recently founded northern population, however, also used a western corridor, but crossed the Mediterranean further east than the western population and overwintered mainly in a new non-breeding area in southern Congo/northern Angola. The migration routes and the new non-breeding range overlapped only slightly with the western, but not with the eastern, population. In contrast, migration phenology appeared to differ between the western and both the northern and the eastern populations, with tracked birds from the western population migrating 2–4 weeks earlier. The northern population thus shares some spatial traits with western Bee-eaters, but similar phenology only with eastern population. This divergence highlights the adjustments in the timing of migration to local environmental conditions in newly founded populations, and a parallel establishment of new breeding and non-breeding sites.},

abstract = {Migratory birds complete their seasonal journeys between breeding and non-breeding sites with a series of migratory flights that are separated by prolonged stopovers. While songbirds are the most common taxa among migratory birds, empirical data on flight and stopover behaviour along their entire migratory journeys are still rare. Here, we integrate activity and barometric pressure tracking with classical light-level geolocation to describe migration behaviour of tawny pipits Anthus campestris breeding in central Europe. Surprisingly, tracked pipits used, on average, as many as 10 stopover sites during their six week, > 5000 km long autumn migration. This conforms to a typical hop-type pattern of migration. In contrast to common knowledge which considers the tawny pipit as a typical diurnal migrant, our data revealed that more than two thirds of all migratory movements were carried out at night. Nocturnal departure times were highly variable within individuals and spread across the entire night while landing most often took place within the first few hours after sunrise. Consequently, there was a negative relationship between departure timing relative to sunset and flight duration. Short flights of up to 2 h were most common and median flight duration was 4.5 h. There was a hyperbolic relationship between flight duration and maximum flight altitude and flight altitudes during night were two times higher compared to daytime. The overall ratio of flight versus stopover duration during migration was on average 1:6.5. This closely matches predictions from theoretical models. We show that multi-sensor tracking has the potential to provide unprecedented details on migratory behaviour of individual birds along their entire migratory journeys, and it also improves the precision of geographical locations derived from light-level geolocators.},

abstract = {Abstract Radar is without alternatives for the study of broad‐scale aerial movements of birds, bats and insects and related issues in biological conservation. Radar techniques are especially useful for investigating species which fly at high altitudes, in darkness, or which are too small for applying electronic tags. Here, we present an overview of radar applications in biological conservation and highlight its future possibilities. Depending on the type of radar, information can be gathered on local‐ to continental‐scale movements of airborne organisms and their behaviour. Such data can quantify flyway usage, biomass and nutrient transport (bioflow), population sizes, dynamics and distributions, times and dimensions of movements, areas and times of mass emergence and swarming, habitat use and activity ranges. Radar also captures behavioural responses to anthropogenic disturbances, artificial light and man‐made structures. Weather surveillance and other long‐range radar networks allow spatially broad overviews of important stopover areas, songbird mass roosts and emergences from bat caves. Mobile radars, including repurposed marine radars and commercially dedicated ‘bird radars', offer the ability to track and monitor the local movements of individuals or groups of flying animals. Harmonic radar techniques have been used for tracking short‐range movements of insects and other small animals of conservation interest. However, a major challenge in aeroecology is determining the taxonomic identity of the targets, which often requires ancillary data obtained from other methods. Radar data have become a global source of information on ecosystem structure, composition, services and function and will play an increasing role in the monitoring and conservation of flying animals and threatened habitats globally.

abstract = {In many taxa, the most common form of sex-biased migration timing is protandry—the earlier arrival of males at breeding areas. Here we test this concept across the annual cycle of long-distance migratory birds. Using more than 350 migration tracks of small-bodied trans-Saharan migrants, we quantify differences in male and female migration schedules and test for proximate determinants of sex-specific timing. In autumn, males started migration about 2 days earlier, but this difference did not carry over to arrival at the non-breeding sites. In spring, males on average departed from the African non-breeding sites about 3 days earlier and reached breeding sites ca 4 days ahead of females. A cross-species comparison revealed large variation in the level of protandry and protogyny across the annual cycle. While we found tight links between individual timing of departure and arrival within each migration season, only for males the timing of spring migration was linked to the timing of previous autumn migration. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that protandry is not exclusively a reproductive strategy but rather occurs year-round and the two main proximate determinants for the magnitude of sex-biased arrival times in autumn and spring are sex-specific differences in departure timing and migration duration.},

abstract = {Radio-transmitters and light-level geolocators are currently small enough for use on songbirds weighing ,15 g. Various methods are used to attach these markers to larger songbirds, but with small birds it becomes especially important to minimize marker mass and bird handling time. Here, we offer modifications to harness materials and marker preparation for transmitters and geolocators, and we describe deployment methods that can be safely completed in 20-60 s per bird. We describe a 0.5-mm elastic sewing thread harness for radio-transmitters that allows nestlings, fledglings, and adults to be marked with the same harness size and reliably falls off to avoid poststudy effects. We also describe a 0.5- mm jewelry cord harness for geolocators that provides a firm fit for .1 yr. Neither harness type requires plastic or metal tubes, rings, or other attachment fixtures on the marker, nor do they require crimping beads, epoxy, scissors, or tying knots while handling birds. Both harnesses add 0.03 g to the mass of markers for small wood-warblers (Parulidae). This minimal additional mass is offset by trimming transmitter antennas or geolocator connection nodes, resulting in no net mass gain for transmitters and 0.02 g added for geolocators compared with conventional harness methods that add .0.40 g. We and others have used this transmitter attachment method with several small songbird species, with no effects on adult and fledgling behavior and survival. We have used this geolocator attachment method on 9-g woodwarblers with no effects on return rates, return dates, territory fidelity, and body mass. We hope that these improvements to the design and deployment of the leg-loop harness method will enable the safe and successful use of these markers, and eventually GPS and other tags, on similarly small songbirds.},

abstract = {Despite many bird species migrating regularly within the African continent, in response to rainfall and breeding opportunities, documented evidence of the spatiotemporal patterns of such movements is scarce. We use satellite telemetry to document the year round movement of an intra-African migrant breeding in the savannah zone of sub-Saharan Africa, the African cuckoo. After breeding in central Nigeria, the birds migrated to more forested sites in the Adamawa region of Cameroon (n = 2) and western Central African Republic (n = 1). Departure from the breeding ground coincided with deteriorating environmental conditions whereas arrival at the non-breeding sites matched period of increasing vegetation greenness. Migratory movements generally occurred during dark hours. In total, an average distance of 748 km in 66 d was covered during the post-breeding migration and 744 km in 27 d during return journey with considerable individual variation and with more stopover sites used during post-breeding migration. The diversity of migration routes followed suggests a relatively variable or flexible initial migration strategy, high individual route consistency as well as high fidelity for non-breeding grounds.},

abstract = {Concentrations of Palaearctic passerines were discovered at the lights of Ngulia Lodge, Tsavo West National Park, Kenya, in December 1969. It was established that such 'falls' of southbound migrants occurred regularly each November and December when there was low mist or rain at night under moonless conditions. They involved three main species, Marsh Warbler Acrocephalus palustris, Thrush Nightingale Luscinia luscinia and Common Whitethroat Sylvia communis, as well as several other migrants not known west of the Kenya highlands, but included surprisingly few Afrotropical birds. Thousands of migrants were often grounded at night, but these moved on within one day. Such concentrations were rare in spring because of a lack of night mist, but a few April falls revealed a very different species composition. From 1972 to 1992 migrants were ringed by small teams each year over November- December new moon periods. Birds were trapped at dawn in mist-nets set in bush south of the Lodge and, from 1976, in one to three nets set below the floodlights at night. In more recent years larger teams have been involved. Dawn operations were moved in 1994 to an area north of the Lodge, beyond the floodlights, resulting in larger catches, often of well over 1000 birds. Experiment at night with playback of recorded song showed some species to be responsive when already brought low by lights and cloud, but overflying migrants did not react and come to ground on clear nights. In autumn (late October to early January) the Lodge has been manned on well over 1100 nights, with mist occurring on over 60% of these and rain on 26%. The incidence of these attractive conditions has been higher later in the season. A total of 499 677 Palaearctic birds ringed to 2012 has given 222 long-distance ringing movements. These comprise 122 to or from Palaearctic breeding areas, 81 to or from Middle East passage sites, 18 from southern African wintering areas and one from a likely Ethiopian stopover area. Only 63 birds ringed have been retrapped at the Lodge in a subsequent season. Catches have involved a mix of first-year and adult birds, in most species in a ratio of about two to one. Racial plumage characteristics and winglengths indicate that most species are from populations breeding in eastern Europe or western/central Asia. Each species has a characteristic seasonality at Ngulia. Marsh Warbler passage picks up only in mid November but continues into January, whereas that of Thrush Nightingale begins earlier but declines in mid December. Species occurring early, mainly in November, include Red-backed Shrike Lanius collurio, Olive-Tree Warbler Hippolais olivetorum, Rufous Scrub Robin Cercotrichas galactotes, Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata and Eurasian Nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus. Patterns of moult are summarized. Some species reach Ngulia with newish looking flight feathers grown the previous July-August, some with very new feathers grown in northeast Africa in October-November, and some with old worn feathers due for renewal in southern Africa in January-March. Details of weights are discussed. Some species are commonly 20-30% and even 50% above lean weight, with a potential for long onward flights. These include Marsh Warbler, Common Whitethroat, River Warbler Locustella fluviatilis, Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, Basra Reed Warbler Acrocephalus griseldis, Olive-Tree Warbler and Red-backed Shrike. By contrast, others such as Irania Irania gutturalis, Common Nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos, Rufous Scrub Robin, Upcher's Warbler Hippolais languida and Isabelline Shrike Lanius isabellinus are rarely more than 20% above lean weight; none of these migrate far south of Ngulia. Species tend to show a small mean weight increase between early November and December. There are significant changes in mean weight from year to year, often by over 5%, suggesting different feeding possibilities and migration strategies. Traces of the annual mean weight of Marsh Warbler and River Warbler correspond closely. At night, weights are lowest between 03:002 and 06:00, then increase during the day to a late afternoon peak 8-10% above the late night minimum. Birds caught after heavy rain tend to have higher weights than those on nights of typical mist. Comparison of the composition of catches over four decades shows a recent increase in the percentage of Marsh Warbler and a decrease in Common Whitethroat. Isabelline Shrike and Rufous Scrub Robin feature much less in catches than formerly, and trends would also suggest a recent decrease in Upcher's Warbler and Willow Warbler. Major outstanding questions concern the location of the autumn stopover areas of the birds which subsequently arrive at Ngulia, and the events by which these are brought down to the lights in such numbers from overhead passage.},

Amongst the Afrotropical Halcyon kingfishers, the behaviour is best known from Central and West Africa where it is documented in three species: chocolate-backed (Halcyon badia), blue-breasted (H. maxima) and woodland (H. senegalensis subspecies fuscopilea) kingfishers (Chapin, 1939; Brosset and Erard, 1986; Fry et al., 1988, 1992; Clancey, 1992).

@article{Meier2018,
abstract = {Abstract: Studying individual flight behaviour throughout the year is indispensable to understand the ecology of a bird species. Recent development in technology allows now to track flight behaviour of small long-distance bird migrants throughout its annual cycle. The specific flight behaviour of twilight ascents in birds has been documented in a few studies, but only during a short period of the year, and never quantified on the individual level. It has been suggested that twilight ascents might be a role in orientation and navigation. Previous studies had reported the behaviour only near the breeding site and during migration. We investigated year-round flight behaviour of 34 individual Alpine swifts (Apus melba) of four different populations in relation to twilight ascents. We recorded twilight ascents all around the year and found a twofold higher frequency in ascents during the non-breeding residence phase in Africa compared to all other phases of the year. Dawn ascents were twice as common as dusk ascents and occurred mainly when atmospheric conditions remained stable over a 24-h period. We found no conclusive support that twilight ascents are essential for recalibration of compass cues and landmarks. Data on the wing flapping intensity revealed that high activity at twilight occurred more regularly than the ascents. We therefore conclude that alpine swift generally increase flight activity—also horizontal flight—during the twilight period and we suppose that this increased flight activity, including ascents, might be part of social interactions between individuals. Significance statement: Year-round flight altitude tracking with a light-weight multi-sensor tag reveals that Alpine swifts ascend several hundred meters high at twilight regularly. The reason for this behaviour remains unclear and the low-light conditions at this time of the day preclude foraging as a possibility. The frequency and altitude of twilight ascents were highest during the non-breeding period, intermediate during migration and low for active breeders during the breeding phase. We discuss our findings in the context of existing hypotheses on twilight ascent and we propose an additional hypothesis which links twilight ascent with social interaction between flock members. Our study highlights how flight behaviour of individuals of a migratory bird species can be studied even during the sparsely documented non-breeding period.},

Over the past decades, several methods with fundamental differences in the analytical approach have been developed to cope with the various caveats and the often complicated data. Here, we explain the concepts behind the analyses of geolocator data and provide a practical guide for the common steps encompassing most analyses – annotation of twilights, calibration, estimating and refining locations, and extraction of movement patterns – describing good practices and common pitfalls for each step. We discuss criteria for deciding whether or not geolocators can answer proposed research questions, provide guidance in choosing an appropriate analysis method and introduce key features of the newest open-source analysis tools. We provide advice for how to interpret and report results, highlighting parameters that should be reported in publications and included in data archiving. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive supplementary online manual that applies the concepts to several datasets, demonstrates the use of open-source analysis tools with step-by-step instructions and code and details our recommendations for interpreting, reporting and archiving.},

Geolocator tags were fitted to nine Red-necked Phalaropes breeding in northern Scotland to assess whether they migrated to Palaearctic or Nearctic wintering grounds. Of four birds known to return, two had retained their tags, of which one was recaptured. This male Phalarope left Shetland on 1 August 2012 and crossed the Atlantic Ocean to the Labrador Sea off eastern Canada in 6 days, then moved south to reach Florida during September, crossed the Gulf of Mexico into the Pacific Ocean and reached an area between the Galapagos Islands and the South American coast by mid-October, where it remained until the end of April, returning by a similar route until the tag battery failed as the bird was crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The total migration of 22 000 km is approximately 60% longer than the previously assumed route to the western part of the Arabian Sea, and this first evidence of migration of a European breeding bird to the Pacific Ocean also helps to indicate the possible migratory route of the large autumn movements of Red-necked Phalaropes down the east coast of North America.},

Methodological advances have also enabled investigators to consider designs that include nearly all common sources of CMR data simultaneously. CMR designs have been generalized to account for many assumptions; however, more emphasis needs to placed on use of auxiliary variables to increase precision and address model assumptions. CMR designs also need to be placed in the larger context of experimentation.

The migration route of north European terns wintering along the coast of western Africa was already described using geolocator data, while knowledge about movements of the European inland populations is based only on relatively scarce recoveries of ringed birds. Methods: We used light-level geolocators in inland Common Tern colonies in Hungary and Croatia to study their migration route and to identify wintering areas along with stopover sites. Results revealed by geolocators were compared with recoveries of ringed birds. Results: All tracked birds used the east African migration route with autumn stopovers at Lower Nile and in the southern part of the Red Sea, and short spring stopover in Israel. Terns wintered along Kenyan coasts and in the southern Mozambique Channel. Autumn migration lasted four times longer than spring migration. Conclusions: This is the first geolocator study that describes the east African migration route of the Common Tern. Important stopover sites were identified. More studies of inland populations are needed to better elucidate tern winter movements.},

abstract = {The small size of the billions of migrating songbirds commuting between temperate breeding sites and the tropics has long prevented the study of the largest part of their annual cycle outside the breeding grounds. Using light-level loggers (geolocators), we recorded the entire annual migratory cycle of the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio, a trans-equatorial Eurasian-African passerine migrant. We tested differences between autumn and spring migration for nine individuals. Duration of migration between breeding and winter sites was significantly longer in autumn (average 96 days) when compared with spring (63 days). This difference was explained by much longer staging periods during autumn (71 days) than spring (9 days). Between staging periods, the birds travelled faster during autumn (356 km d-1) than during spring (233 km d-1). All birds made a protracted stop (53 days) in Sahelian sub-Sahara on southbound migration. The birds performed a distinct loop migration (22 000 km) where spring distance, including a detour across the Arabian Peninsula, exceeded the autumn distance by 22 per cent. Geographical scatter between routes was particularly narrow in spring, with navigational convergence towards the crossing point from Africa to the Arabian Peninsula. Temporal variation between individuals was relatively constant, while different individuals tended to be consistently early or late at different departure/arrival occasions during the annual cycle. These results demonstrate the existence of fundamentally different spatio-temporal migration strategies used by the birds during autumn and spring migration, and that songbirds may rely on distinct staging areas for completion of their annual cycle, suggesting more sophisticated endogenous control mechanisms than merely clockand- compass guidance among terrestrial solitary migrants. After a century with metal-ringing, year-round tracking of long-distance migratory songbirds promises further insights into bird migration. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Preclinical animal studies have established stressors, substance use associated cues, and priming as distinct triggers of relapse in substance dependence. These triggers seem to induce relapse by activating distinct brain pathways. In order to test these findings in humans, it is necessary to establish new human research paradigms. Neuroimaging may help to study brain regions involved in mediating the effects of these distinct triggers of relapse and to further delineate mediators of these pathways. In order to understand individual differences it is crucial to assess the impact of moderators on these pathways to relapse. METHODS: Paradigms to study distinct relapse triggers are currently being set up for tobacco dependence. It is practically impossible to study human relapse and specifically its neurobiological pathways in the natural surrounding. Instead we aim to establish vulnerability patterns in a laboratory environment, applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessments during trigger exposure. Brain activation determined by fMRI may constitute a sensitive measure to assess responses to cues, stress, and priming. Establishing these paradigms will then allow to further delineate the role of possible mediators (e.g. attention, inhibition) and moderators (e.g. sex, genetic factors) underlying relapse to smoking. RESULTS: Initial results are encouraging, but this approach needs further studies to proof its usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: We outline an approach to study nicotine relapse within a laboratory environment, using fMRI assessments during trigger exposure. The long term goal is rational treatment development. To reach this goal it is crucial to identify, include and investigate critical moderators and mediators of relapse within this approach.},

abstract = {Wildlife management and conservation is becoming ever more complex. Concomitantly, managers are in need of simple quantitative approaches and tools that could help them to make better management decisions. We present an approach that consists of generating a single simulated data set of expected data using a reference model, to which various capture-recapture models can be fitted. Using the general-purpose capture-recapture software M-SURGE, we apply this approach to bias, precision, and power calculations. After a quick statistical background refresher, we illustrate this approach with 3 simple examples: 1) the bias induced on survival by capture heterogeneity, 2) the precision of an estimate in the context of a reward-band study, and 3) the power of a test for detecting compensatory mortality. We believe this numerical approach based on expected values can potentially be applied to complex cases, thus making it possible to deal with real situations. We advocate that bias, precision, and power calculations be more routinely performed at the design stage of management or conservation studies. We believe the method we present can become a valuable tool to facilitate wildlife management and conservation.},

abstract = {Population monitoring traditionally relies on population counts, accounting or not for the issue of detectability. However, this approach does not permit to go into details on demographic processes. Therefore, Capture-Recapture (CR) surveys have become popular tools for scientists and practitioners willing to measure survival response to environmental change or conservation actions. However, CR surveys are expensive and their design is often driven by the available resources, without estimation about the level of precision they provide for detecting changes in survival, despite optimising resource allocation in wildlife monitoring is increasingly important. Investigating how CR surveys could be optimised by manipulating resource allocation among different design components is therefore critically needed. We have conducted a simulation experiment exploring the statistical power of a wide range of CR survey designs to detect changes in the survival rate of birds. CR surveys differ in terms of number of breeding pairs monitored, number of offspring and adults marked, resighting effort and survey duration. We compared open-nest (ON) and nest-box (NB) monitoring types, using medium- and long-lived model species. Increasing survey duration and number of pairs monitored increased statistical power. Long survey duration can provide accurate estimations for long-lived birds even for small population size (15 pairs). A cost-benefit analysis revealed that for long-lived ON species, ringing as many chicks as possible appears as the most effective survey component, unless a technique for capturing breeding birds at low cost is available to compensate for reduced local recruitment. For medium-lived NB species, focusing the NB rounds at a period that maximises the chance to capture breeding females inside nest-boxes is more rewarding than ringing all chicks. We show that integrating economic costs is crucial when designing CR surveys and discuss ways to improve efficiency by reducing duration to a time scale compatible with management and conservation issues.},

abstract = {Background: Over the past decade, the miniaturisation of animal borne tags such as geolocators and GPS-transmitters has revolutionized our knowledge of the whereabouts of migratory species. Novel light-weight multi-sensor loggers (1.4g), which harbour sensors for measuring ambient light intensity, atmospheric pressure, temperature and acceleration, were fixed to two long-distance migrant bird species - eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops) and great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). Using acceleration and atmospheric pressure data recorded every 5 and 30min, respectively, we aimed at reconstructing individual diurnal and seasonal patterns of flight activity and flight altitude and thereby, at describing basic, yet hitherto unknown characteristics of migratory flight behaviour. Furthermore, we wanted to characterise the variability in these migration characteristics between individuals, species and migration periods. Results: The flight duration from breeding to sub-Saharan African non-breeding sites and back was more variable within than between the species. Great reed warblers were airborne for a total of 252 flight hours and thus, only slightly longer than eurasian hoopoes with 232h. With a few exceptions, both species migrated predominantly nocturnally - departure around dusk and landing before dawn. Mean flight altitudes were higher during pre- than during post-breeding migration (median 1100 to 1600ma.s.l.) and flight above 3000m occurred regularly with a few great reed warblers exceeding 6000ma.s.l. (max. 6458ma.s.l.). Individuals changed flight altitudes repeatedly during a flight bout, indicating a continuous search for (more) favourable flight conditions. Conclusions: We found high variation between individuals in the flight behaviour parameters measured - a variation that surprisingly even exceeded the variation between the species. More importantly, our results have shown that multi-sensor loggers have the potential to provide detailed insights into many fundamental aspects of individual behaviour in small aerial migrants. Combining the data recorded on the multiple sensors with, e.g., remote sensing data like weather and habitat quality on the spatial and temporal scale will be a great step forward to explore individual decisions during migration and their consequences.},

In general, those in the first and third categories are absent only in the coldest months, but the presence of those in the second is largely tied to the rains. Some other species migrate to higher latitudes to moult, not to breed, spending the rains in what are generally drier regions. Most such examples are ground-feeding birds of open grasslands. It is possible that the same populations of certain species breed twice in the year: in moist lower latitudes in the dry season, in drier higher latitudes in the rains. There are doubtless instances of migration still undetected. Investigation is needed as to why some species are migratory on one side of the equator, but not the other.

This research assesses the impact of land use change on mangrove dynamics and shoreline erosion as well as the main driving factors that cause these changes in Watamu Midacreek. This study uses old aerial photographs (1969 and 1989), current high resolution satellite images World view (2010) and ground truthing in combination with information from the local community to analyze the impact of change in land use from 1969-2010. Land use and cover types were visually interpreted, digitized and delineated using aerial photographs of 1969, 1989 and 2010 satellite images in ArcGIS.9.3.1 and ERDAS IMAGINE 2014 software. The results of the land use change between 1969 and 1989 showed a decline of scrub land, miscellaneous coastal vegetation, coastal bush, thicket with trees and mangroves, whereas new types of land use which emerged during this period were town and barren land. The greatest land use change rate observed between 1969 and 1989 was in miscellaneous coastal vegetation at 2.5%, while coastal bush experienced a significant negative change rate of −6.5%. The main land use changes observed between 1989 and 2010 were increasing coastal bush, an expansion of town and urban areas, hotels and private holiday houses. Encroachments into the mangrove forest have been observed both by local people and foreign private holiday house owners. The change in land use had an impact on shoreline changes as well. Areas mainly covered by old trees, and coastal bushes which protected the shoreline from erosion currently have been converted into very big hotels and several private holiday house complexes. The main drivers of land use change were human population growth and policy (through weakness of law enforcement). Policies and regu-lations which are not currently implemented need to be updated based on the current pressure-state situation, and there should be strong law enforcement and strict regulation to control any unplanned developments along the coast and in the neighboring hinterland.},

abstract = {Birds in the northern hemisphere usually increase mass reserves in response to seasonal low temperatures and shorter day length that increase foraging unpredictability and so starvation risk. In the lowland tropics, relatively low temperatures and short day lengths are absent and so the risk of starvation may be reduced, leading to much smaller seasonal effects on mass. Nevertheless, other factors such as high temperatures and water and food availability may vary greatly between tropical wet and dry seasons, leading to variable starvation risk and seasonal mass effects. Using data collected from 47 species of birds caught over a 10-year period in a tropical savannah region in West Africa we tested for seasonal variation in mass in response to a predictable, strongly seasonal tropical climate. Many species (91%) showed seasonal variation in mass, and this was often in a clear annual pattern that was constant across the years. Many species (89%) varied their mass in response to seasonally predictable rainfall. Annual variation in mass was also important (45% of species). Relatively few species (13%) had a seasonal pattern of mass variation that varied between years. Feeding guild or migratory status was not found to affect seasonal or annual mass variation. Seasonal mass change was on average 8.1% across the 21 species with a very large sample size and was comparable with both northern and southern temperate species. Our study showed that biologically significant consistent seasonal mass variation is common in tropical savannah bird species, and this is most likely in response to changing resource availability brought about by seasonal rainfall and the interrupted foraging response due to the constraints of breeding. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Currently, the deployment of tracking devices is one of the most frequently used approaches to study movement ecology of birds. Recent miniaturization of light-level geolocators enabled studying small bird species whose migratory patterns were widely unknown. However, geolocators may reduce vital rates in tagged birds and may bias obtained movement data. There is a need for a thorough assessment of the potential tag effects on small birds, as previous meta-analyses did not evaluate unpublished data and impact of multiple life-history traits, focused mainly on large species and the number of published studies tagging small birds has increased substantially. We quantitatively reviewed 549 records extracted from 74 published and 48 unpublished studies on over 7,800 tagged and 17,800 control individuals to examine the effects of geolocator tagging on small bird species (body mass <100 g). We calculated the effect of tagging on apparent survival, condition, phenology and breeding performance and identified the most important predictors of the magnitude of effect sizes. Even though the effects were not statistically significant in phylogenetically controlled models, we found a weak negative impact of geolocators on apparent survival. The negative effect on apparent survival was stronger with increasing relative load of the device and with geolocators attached using elastic harnesses. Moreover, tagging effects were stronger in smaller species. In conclusion, we found a weak effect on apparent survival of tagged birds and managed to pinpoint key aspects and drivers of tagging effects. We provide recommendations for establishing matched control group for proper effect size assessment in future studies and outline various aspects of tagging that need further investigation. Finally, our results encourage further use of geolocators on small bird species but the ethical aspects and scientific benefits should always be considered.},

abstract = {We estimated annual rates of survival for juvenile and adult Swainson's Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) using capture-recapture analyses from 22 years of mist-neting data in coastal California (n= 2,651 individual captures). Our apparent survival estimate was 56% for adults and 25% for juveniles. We are the first to estimate an annual juvenile survival rate for a Neotropical migrant using capture-recapture probability estimates. Like most estimates of annual survival, we could not distinguish between dispersal away from our study area (which is likely high for juveniles) and mortality. Hence, survival is underestimated. However, our juvenile survival estimate did not include the period from fledging to independence, a time when mortality can be high. Many researchers have assumed juvenile survival to be half that of adult survival in population models (e.g. source-sink). Our juvenile to adult survival ratio was 45% (95% CI = 27 to 65%). We caution researchers from simply assuming that juvenile survival approximates half of adult survival when modeling populations and suggest using a range of values. Using a range of values is prudent because of the potential for annual variation, site-specific variation, and especially because estimates are imprecise or completely lacking.},
